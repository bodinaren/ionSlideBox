# ionSlideBox
Adds dynamic height behavior on slides for ionSlideBox in Ionic.

## Install
Simply add the .js file to your project, add the `<script>`-tag and include the module 'bodin'. This is just an extension of Ionic's `<ion-slide-box>`, so just keep using their directive as you normally would.
